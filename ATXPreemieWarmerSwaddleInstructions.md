This pattern and tutorial was designed to come up with a simple, low-cost insukated swaddle blanket with a pocket for a portable heating element for preterm babies in the developing world. The pictures in this model show a blanket made with two pieces of plain cotton fabric, one scrap piece of black felt, and an old flannel t-shirt. The design was made with the ability to be made with 2 Adult Large t-shirts and an old shoelace. The body of the t-shirts could be layered as desired for insulation and the pocket could be made out of a sleeve of one of the t-shirts. 

This design was created at the ATX Hack for Change in Austin, Texas. The design was created by Cameron Lagrone. Feel free to contact Cameron at Cameron.Lagrone@gmail.com with any questions.

Step 4: Fold under and iron ¼” of fabric around edges of pocket fabric. 

Step 5: Sew on right side long edge from top to bottom on pocket. 

Step 6: Place pocket fold side down on the inner lining of the blanket fabric, and sew along all three remaining edges (top, left side and bottom side). Leave right long side open. This creates a pocket into which to slide the heating element.
