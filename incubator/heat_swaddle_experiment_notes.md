8:15 begin
at 8:39, Duty Cycle 0.13 at 1.05 amps.
12.4 Watts

I feel like experiment must be repeated with water.  I don’t believe the whole gel-pack is warm.

Duty Cycle 0.21
11.63 Watts

Notes: Now performing test with 2 bags of water.
Beginning at room temperature at 9:00.  Expect it to take 45 minutes to reach steady state.

9:39 reopeating experiment with 32 ounces of water, which seems more manageable.

Temperature starting at 23.73.

Should take 20 * 907 * 4.184  = 6324 or two hours.
at 
At 10:54, measuring 30.57.

At 11:59, I have a duty cycle of 0.6!

Both good and bad.

Measuring later, up to 0.66.  So basically 
that means 8 watts per second continuously
for 32 ounces of water— which isn’t even very 
good.

Starting at 10:29, placed two sheets of foam core under heating pad (within pocket.)
Temperature started at 20.31.  My goal is to run till steady state and hope duty cycle has gone down.

30.C at 11:35.  (This is a greater rise than we got last night, initially suggesting that the insulation is valuable.)

By 12:16 (but proably before) we were in a steady state, and I began doing the duty cycle computtation, which I will let run for an hour.  My supposition is that it will be less than 0.66.

At 12:38, duty cycle is 0.22!!

At 1:18, duty cycle is 0.28.  I consider this a very successful result!  This has to be included in the basic design.
