(This is mostly in preparation for Mini Maker Faire.)

## Prove that heating blanket works with MOSFET

Prove that I can drive the new heating blanket with the MOSFET that I used for the fan.

## Work with remote Temperature sensor

Prove that I can read the temperature effectively with the remote transistor

## Attempt to use PID library to maintain the temperature correctly.

## Construct working prototype

## Make run on low power

This is an exclellent article: https://www.openhomeautomation.net/arduino-battery/

It talks about both the hardware and software.  For our purposes we could deal with the software first (should be almost trivial) and then deal with the hardware later.)

# Extra Credit

Build a temperature sensing test infant that let's you know when it is too cold or too hot.

Here is the working temperature circuit with a red, green, blue LED.

If I can figure out how to package this it should be usable as a model we can test with:
