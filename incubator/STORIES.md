(This is mostly in preparation for Mini Maker Faire.)

## Prove that heating blanket works with MOSFET

Prove that I can drive the new heating blanket with the MOSFET that I used for the fan.

## Work with remote Temperature sensor

Prove that I can read the temperature effectively with the remote transistor

## Attempt to use PID library to maintain the temperature correctly.

## Construct working prototype

# Extra Credit

Build a temperature sensing test infant that let's you know when it is too cold or too hot.
