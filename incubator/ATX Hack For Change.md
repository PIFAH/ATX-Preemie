# ATX Hack for Change Challenge

Hack Hardware for Change!

Each year many premature babies die due to lack of adequate care.  Perhaps the biggest contributor to this and the
easiest to fix is the fact that premature babies have trouble regulating their own body temperature and staying warm.

The problem is being addressed by [Embrace Global](http://embraceglobal.org), a charity that provides infant warmers
from a for-profit company, [Embrace Innovations](http://www.embraceinnovations.com).

Neither of these are producing replicatable, open-source solutions.

In this project create by the Austin chapter of Engineers Without Borders, we will try to improve an existing prototype
of an electronic warmer, and explore other inexpensive, low-cost solutions.

This project offers opportunities for internet research, sewing, very simple chemistry, Arduino programming, and
construction of electronics. We will adjust what we work on to fit your skills and interest. This is a great way to learn
some hardware hacking! A list of potential stories to accomplish has been published at the EWB GitHub [Repository](https://github.com/PIFAH/EWB/issues).

Note that this project is similar in goals to one done by students at Rice University, [IncuBaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VaYNRd7NA4&feature=youtu.be)
