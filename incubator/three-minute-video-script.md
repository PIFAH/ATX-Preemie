Rob: Every year, more than a hundred thousand babies that are born prematurely die preventably due to a lack of
Western medicine. Of the many challenges they face, maintaining bodyheat is one of the most important and easy to address.
Others are addressing this problem with different approaches, but we are are trying to make a open-source system that 
anyone can freely build and improve upon.

Camreon: Our fundmanetal approach is to make a swaddle that can be easily sewed together from a pattern using scrap materials,
such as old cotten t-shirts and a shoe string.  The easy-to-make swaddle holds the child securely, and insulates the
head while leaving the face open. In the back of the swaddle is a pocket for the simple insertion of the heating cloth.

Rob: The heating cloth is powered with the kind of minimal battery power potentially avialable to people that don't have 
grid power, but have the ability to charge cell-phone batteries. The cloth is controlled by the extremely popular Arduino 
microcontroller, which can be purchased for as little as $5 dollars.  Currently our total bill-of-materials costs about $30,
and we are striving to lower that.

Josh: To increase the safety and robustness of the system, we implemented a audible alarm when the temperature is too low
or too high.  The temperature is read from a sensor at the baby's tummy, which costs 95 cents. We are researching better
temperature sensors and ways to make the system safer.

Cameron: If no battery power is avaliable, the swaddle is still a convenient way to hold, carry, and transport the baby 
when not in the mother's arms.  We support the "Kangaroo Care" model of infant care, but want to give health care workers
an inexpensive option when the mother is sick or incapacitated or for transport to a better clinic.
