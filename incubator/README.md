# Incubator for premature infants

This is a directory to contain documentation on our work attempting to build an incubator for premature infants.

We are currently championing a project at [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/schedule/), please see our [informational file](https://github.com/PIFAH/EWB/blob/master/incubator/ATX%20Hack%20For%20Change.md) on that project.


We are working on an inexpensive incubator to keep premature infants at healthy temperature.

Note that this probably is being wonderfully addressed by [Embrace.org](http://embraceglobal.org/embrace-warmer/), which has made a $200 warmer.

We are not necessarily aiming to replace or improve upon the Embrace warmer, but rather to explore a different point in the design spectrum.
