# Incubator for premature infants

This is a directory to contain documentation on our work attempting to build an incubator for premature infants.


We are working on an inexpensive incubator to keep premature infants at healthy temperature.

Note that this probably is being wonderfully addressed by [Embrace.org](http://embraceglobal.org/embrace-warmer/), which has made a $200 warmer.

We are not necessarily aiming to replace or improve upon the Embrace warmer, but rather to explore a different point in the design spectrum.
