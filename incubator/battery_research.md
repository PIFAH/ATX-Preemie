# Battery Research

This file is to keep our battery research.

Now that we are effectively measuring the ability to maintain skin temperature (35C) within the swaddle with a 2 pound
water mass while measure watts, we can make accurate watt-hour computations.

Our intial test suggests that for a 2-pound mass (which is too small http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight, I know!) we can maintain heat with 8 watts.  So a
four hour shift would require 32 watt-hours.

This is an excellent article:

Looking at the table "D Battery Comparison at 3.0 Amp Rate", we see a range of approximately 1.0 to 2.0 Watt hours per D-Cell.
(Note that we currently draw 1 amp, not 3, I am not sure how that will affect this---not much, I assume.)

So if we use 1.0 Watt Hour per D cell, it would seem that we need 32 D cells for a 4 hour shift.  It seems unlikely
that that will be effective for our situation (although we can in fact survive a lower voltage level than other applications,
since we have a pure resistive load.

Not that I am not 100% sure of this calculation.

Also, a small improve in insultation could greatly affect this.  Furthermore, the heat production of the infant itself could 
help us.
