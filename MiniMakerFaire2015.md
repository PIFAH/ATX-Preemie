On May 16th and 17th, the Instrumentation Group spoke at and staffed a table a at the Austin 2015 Mini Maker Faire.

It was a great time, and we answered questions from approximately 70 persons at our table. We demonstrated 4 separate
projects, all of which were designed to be low-cost, open source projects.

The soil moisture sensor and Petrfilm incubator are essentially done and working projects (though we need to document 
them better here.)  The [Neonatal Incubator](https://github.com/PIFAH/EWB/tree/master/incubator) and [Latrine Fan](https://github.com/PIFAH/EWB/tree/master/latrine) are still works-in-progress.


The pictures below where taken at a rare time on Sunday afternoon when nobody was asking us any questions at our table!
