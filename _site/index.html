  # ATX Preemie Warmer v 0.1 Alpha

Every year across the world, many low-birth weight babies die, in part because they do not have access to advanced medicine.

This is an open-source hardware and software project to try to address this problem.

The project is begin addressed by [Embrace Global](http://embraceglobal.org). However, that project supports a for-profit company, and it is not an open-source solution. 

An Arduino-based, heating pad-style solution was originally suggested by Stewart Holloway of the Austin Chapter of Engineers without Borders.

Robert L. Read developed a prototype, and then led a team to improve it a the [ATX Hack for Change](http://publicinvention.blogspot.com/2015/06/report-atx-hack-for-change-2015-preemie.html) Hackathon.

Although still in a development phase, the project seems worth continuing. We are seeking team members to help with this project.

In this repo, you will find a wealth of information about both the hardware, sewing, and software components of the project. The [issues](https://github.com/PIFAH/ATX-Preemie/issues) represent a variety of valuble ways to hack this project forward.

If you want to potentially save lives, empower people with limited resources, and have fun building Arduino projects, please contact me (Robert L. Read, <read.robert@gmail.com>, @RobertLRead) and lets figure out how you can have fun helping with this project.
