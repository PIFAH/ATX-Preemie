One can imagine a single "sled" which is really a PCB integrated with some insulation.  It contains an Arduino and resistive elements
both to create all the heat.  The sled has a tiny heat mass near the baby to prevent hot spots, and insulation and
reflectance on the back side to move heat upward.  One can even imagine using "frozen smoke" as the insulation.

Perhaps the sled could be manufactured with instructions to swaddle it.  It's only needed interface with the outside world
would be two micro USB ports, to stack to 3.7 volt inputs into the arduino.

The arduino itself draws 250 mA at 5 V = 1.2 watts, which is quite signifincant on a system that may need as little as 3.5 watts
to in general.
