# Battery Research

This file is to keep our battery research.

Now that we are effectively measuring the ability to maintain skin temperature (35C) within the swaddle with a 2 pound
water mass while measure watts, we can make accurate watt-hour computations.

Our intial test suggests that for a 2-pound mass (which is too small http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight, I know!) we can maintain heat with 8 watts.  So a
four hour shift would require 32 watt-hours.

This is an excellent article:

Looking at the table "D Battery Comparison at 1.0 Amp Rate", we see a range of approximately 5.5 to 8 Watt hours per D-Cell.
(Note that we currently draw 1 amp, not 3, I am not sure how that will affect this---not much, I assume.)

So if we use 1.0 Watt Hour per D cell, it would seem that we need 4-6 cells for a 4 hour shift. (Note this is similar to a 6 Volt lantern battery.) 

Not that I am not 100% sure of this calculation.

Also, a small improve in insultation could greatly affect this.  Furthermore, the heat production of the infant itself could 
help us.

Note that two AA batteries can get us to 3 Watthours.  With my recent insulation results, this could be almost enough.

It is possible that external battery packs could be a good option.

That claims to be 3.2 Ah at 3.7 volts, for 11.84 Watt hours!  If we could charge one like that it would be really tremendous!

We need to figure out how to get that power USB interface!  Note also that if we can do maintenance of power at lower voltage, we might be able to charge the Arduino AND power this (though we will still need a separate circuit!)
