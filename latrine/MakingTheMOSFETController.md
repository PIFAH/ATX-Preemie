I've followed this excellent tutorial: http://bildr.org/2012/03/rfp30n06le-arduino/
to make a controllwer for the Latrine Fan.

It took literally an entire day, but I soldered together a MOSFET controller that now works.  I had a loose wire that 
costs me about 3 hours of figuring to understand.

The images below show the project after I placed the components, the back side, the back side after soldering, and
after trimming off the leads.

I do NOT claim this is good construction technique.  I am still learning.  But it is our principle at PIFAH to document
everything, so here you are.

This now switches 12V power from two lantern batteries into the latrine fan very nicely based on an Arduino digital output.

Observe the way I tried to layout the circuit first on paper --- I changed this when I was actually soldering to add another spacer row to have a little more room.
