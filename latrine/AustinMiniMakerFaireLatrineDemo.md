Tony Stark, I ain't.

It took a long time to get this done and working and all packaged up, and the result is an anticlimax. I have a cardboard
box with a fan, with a little sensor hanging out of it. If you spray the sensor with gas from a cigarette lighter, 
the fan comes on.  That's it.

In the picture, the sensor is the little mesh covered gadget on the left side of the box.

However, this box does demonstrate that we an switch almost any amount of power with an Arduino combined with a tiny MOSFET
circuit. The Fan is driven by a 6V - 12V battery, and draws far more current than the Arduino itself can provide.

The fact that we can do this with one sensor means we could easily do this with any other sensor, or combination of sensors.

Moreover, this system is very similar to the Incubator project, which I view as an advantage.
