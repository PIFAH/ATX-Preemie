## Tasks

* Try to build the MOSFET/Diode Circuit mentioned on the Sparkfun site http://bildr.org/2012/03/rfp30n06le-arduino/ (I think I have all the components for this.)
* Buy two 6-V lantern batteries in order to test my ability to do this at 6V and 12V (final installation is expected to be 12V.)
