# EWB

This repository is to hold word done by [Engineers Without Borders, Greater Austin Chapter](http://ewbgreateraustin.org), particularly for the instrumentation group.

## Project: Latrine Fan

We are builing a latrine for a local organic farm organization. The Instrumentation group in particular is prototyping a gas-sensor activated fan.


The photo https://github.com/PIFAH/EWB/blob/master/SenseAndReact.jpg is a sorry substitute for a schematic, but this circuit is in such a prototype form and is such a simple modification of work from the Arduino Experimenter's kit that it is not worth documenting more fully.

## Project: Premature Infant Incubator

We are working on an inexpensive incubator to keep premature infants at healthy temperature.
